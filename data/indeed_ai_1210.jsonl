You're skilled at every stage of the ML lifecycle—from defining problems and exploring data, to developing, deploying, and iterating on models. You adeptly balance rigorous modeling with practical software engineering, integrating ML solutions seamlessly into production systems. You understand the nuances between offline metrics and real-world performance, translating complex, abstract problems into actionable ML strategies.\nYou thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments, approaching challenges with curiosity and analytical rigor. Complex, unsolved problems, particularly those involving visual data and behavioral analysis, motivate you. You're passionate about making tangible impacts by taking ownership of projects from initial prototype through production deployment.\nAbout Us\nSenseye is a NeuroTechnology Company in Austin, TX on the cusp of revolutionizing Mental Health. Over the past 6 years we have invested millions of dollars in R&D to build our platform allowing us to measure cognitive activity via the eye through mobile phones. Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change.

So, just a quick note...I am an actual real person posting this, not a bot, no AI...just a real live human. In addition, you can expect that responses from your application will also come from me...not a bot, not an ATS.\nThis role has a few very key social fit characteristics to it. So, allow me to explain those for you:\nThe words 'this is not my job' are not really something you will hear at this particular client. So, if you like to dive into stuff that may not be in your exact responsibilities list, that is precisely the kind of person we are seeking for this role.\nThis role is for that person that likes to try stuff and figures things out. Have you been in roles in your past where you had no previous knowledge of what you were going to be digging your fingers into? Then, you are right on target for what we are seeking.\nAre you the kind of person that really likes to learn? If so, then (like with the two previous points) we are going to have the workings of a fit here. You will be given access to Pluralsight as well as a bunch of internal tools to learn new stuff...\nFor this role, we are ideally seeking individuals that are within driving distance to Hebron Kentucky. This role is being done in a hybrid manner....roughly 3 days onsite and 2 days remote. I am going to be honest here...if you are staunchly focused, solely on how many days onsite & how many days remote, you probably aren't the person for this role. In addition, there will be trips (once a month) to New York City where you will be traveling for - roughly - 2 days a month to New York City.\nI can only work with US Citizens or Green Card Holders for this role. So, if you are an H1, OPT, EAD, STEM, F1, or other Visa holder and are not already a US Citizen or Green Card holder, we won't be able to work together for this role.\nIn addition, I am not working with external vendors or 3rd parties for this role.\nFor this role, you will be working with Systems Administration, AWS, Tanium, Intune, Microsoft 365, Storage, and Virtualization. The AWS and Tanium piece is the most important part o this role. You will evaluate, recommend, and implementing new technologies as well as serve as tier 3 escalation support. You won't be alone in this role. There is a team of 8 (you will be the 9th member of this team) Sys & Network admins and Sys & Network Engineers that you will be working with. This client has about 2,000 employees. However, from a user group perspective, there are roughly 1,600 across the US, Canada, UK / EU, India and the Philippines.\nHere are some of those main responsibilities for this role:\nOversee internal infrastructure including data centers, networks, telephony, storage and end user computing.\nPerform server administration across a mixed OS environment (Linux and Windows).\nProvide support in problem prevention and resolution for complex infrastructure issues for enterprise infrastructure groups.\nManage and optimize AWS infrastructure including EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, and backups to ensure availability, performance, and security. This should also include performance tuning, patching, incident response & compliance.\nAutomate deployments and maintenance using scripting and Infrastructure-as-Code tools like CloudFormation or Terraform.\nAdministration and maintenance of endpoint management platforms such as Tanium to ensure secure configuration, patch compliance, and real-time visibility across all servers and workstations.\nManage Microsoft 365 and Azure AD administration, including user accounts, groups, permissions, and policy configuration to maintain secure and efficient operations.\nHere are the things we are seeking in a candidate:\nExperience managing Linux and Windows servers, automation scripting (Python, PowerShell, or Bash).\nFamiliarity with NIST, SOC 2, or PCI standards and implementation of least-privilege access controls.\nAt least 5 years of experience of Systems Administration experience (this is a must have / gotta have). The more experience, the better. However, I am going to be more interested in breadth and depth of experience than true 'years' of experience. So, if you have 5-6 years of Sys Admin experience where you were the only Sys Admin for an environment, that will be more important than someone with 9 years of experience...but was on a team of 20 Sys Admins.\nCertifications like: Proxmox, VMWare, AWS: Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect, CloudOps Engineer, andSolutions Architect are things that the hiring manager is really seeking.\nOther certs that we would like to see are: CompTIA Network+, ITIL, CompTIA Server+, Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA), CompTIA Security+, and Microsoft Certified Security Operations Analyst Associate.\nPay: $70,000.00 - $90,000.00 per year\nBenefits:\n401(k)\n401(k) matching\nDental insurance\nHealth insurance\nLife insurance\nPaid time off\nVision insurance\nWork Location: Hybrid remote in Hebron, KY 41048", "url": "https://www.indeed.com/pagead/clk?mo=r&ad=-6NYlbfkN0AiEXHS0xdYoQwXybiHBjbLwLkoEHteLdPS1xmybkl800n8hWv-3VKuFiXQaeaeosGB3gQEokK7fhL4bv7IODtWFCIRpkRV7oDzcwKxvE3dLXhLRN7B7pR5Z1YeSXffv0yCWhyyI1KNhsNVMY2HGfU_3L8XhjAO6inA84Iw1S8YcUkHfAjciCeEHe4aZ652MeOegn4EPt9ZGw-nR0BXrgl2D5dRXh0KPmhx8JQcNNR1sG_wRTO6bV5maWinNSSRPnQLjBjQdWmAXclkmsrRVSt_7OF-BmEYNOFCgIqilMOKsGzdnM86-9BBKM4WZUVuSgJJO0Z9CKdFRDz8SQ61hpXvxlo4cK3VldpX65M_pFZIg_kUcJNKab-4Auads07Ja6elU7iV9ipImVpeZ-Ce9BsfnXN7EhzKhqN0ExLfkjdLOHH8wrEkZQ2SIE5dzwXeTAoZKJATB0cUcvpDj5j-bso0rJ1IWiK9jVRsINtVhmfrQlpKK8AU0SlryZTThJz51Y1wwc4thT4sdDaad7k49wMnmm-0VP0boKtPcD8zOIFKXw43QGKSDCtabdxH7sZieGGT98lhC6AD95pDjC502MR0IpTZoi-M0rfaKHaKRx1EeGYOB-wyb3P-3NgupP8KgMnzs-M8OyORLzrez9vWn_KILZyHYxyamlUTfJbfnIrxJ4ej4tspORML0JWsxEvi8NI=&xkcb=SoCn6_M3pDcURlyDlp0ObzkdCdPP&camk=UoKtGZLa3XK10SNVAopzlg==&p=5&fvj=0&vjs=3&tk=1jc3a6sf4i8ov800&jsa=3481&oc=1&sal=1"}
