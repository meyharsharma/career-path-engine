Ensure roadmaps align to broader AI strategy and planning cadences, and are grounded in realistic delivery assumptions.\nVendor Evaluation: Participate in vendor reviews, assess solution fit and integration feasibility, and support total cost of ownership analysis. Coordinate demo sessions and synthesize findings to inform vendor selection and onboarding.\nCross-Functional Collaboration: Partner closely with strategy leads, product managers, data scientists, engineers, and risk partners to drive alignment, clarify requirements, and advance AI opportunities from intake through initial planning.

You will be instrumental in N3C's next evolutionary step: the transition to a scalable, secure, and flexible \"Dynamic Workspaces\" model. You won't just be maintaining pipelines; you will be re-architecting, modernizing, and scaling the systems that ingest and harmonize a diverse torrent of data. From EHRs and CMS claims to cancer registries and geospatial data, you will be making it research-ready for thousands of scientists.\nIf you are a builder who thrives on complex challenges and wants your work to have a tangible, lasting impact on science and medicine, we want to talk to you.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\nArchitect and Modernize National-Scale Data Pipelines: Design, develop, and optimize robust, disease-agnostic data acquisition and ingestion pipelines built to handle the complexity and scale of N3C.\nMaster Data Integration and Harmonization: Tackle the complex challenge of harmonizing heterogeneous clinical data from countless sources. You will maintain and enhance the OMOP harmonization pipeline, improve interoperability between common data models (e.g., OMOP, PCORNet, FHIR), and ensure consistency for critical data like medications and lab values.\nBuild the Future with Dynamic Workspaces: Be a key technical player in developing the infrastructure for N3C's new Dynamic Workspaces. You will help build the systems that provision secure, project-specific analytical environments, giving researchers access to the specific data they need while providing institutions granular control.\nChampion Data Quality and Governance: Develop and implement sophisticated data quality frameworks, creating dashboards and feedback loops to ensure our data partners and researchers have transparent insight into data completeness, consistency, and quality.\nInnovate with Advanced Technologies: Integrate critical new data sources, including national mortality data and CMS. You will link datasets and help build the processes for integrating novel data types like geospatial and environmental data.\nCollaborate and Lead: Work alongside a world-class team of scientists, project managers, and engineers to translate scientific needs into technical solutions. You will provide technical leadership and mentorship, driving best practices in an agile, mission-focused environment.\n\nWhat You'll Bring (Required Qualifications):\nA deep passion for using technology to solve meaningful problems in healthcare and medical research.\nBachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Data Engineering, Bioinformatics, or a related field, with 8+ years of hands-on experience in data engineering (or 5+ years with a Master's).\nExpert-level proficiency in Python and SQL, with a proven track record of building and maintaining complex, large-scale data pipelines and ETL processes.\nSignificant experience with healthcare data is essential. You must have deep, practical knowledge of common data models (CDMs), particularly OMOP and/or FHIR, and experience with clinical terminologies (e.g., ICD, SNOMED, RxNorm).\nStrong experience with big data technologies (e.g., Apache Spark, Hadoop) and containerization using Docker for creating reproducible and scalable workflows.\nProficiency with version control (Git) and CI/CD practices for data infrastructure.\nAn architectural mindset with the ability to design for scalability, reliability, and security.\n\nWhat Sets You Apart (Preferred Qualifications):\nExperience designing and deploying data solutions on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).\nProficiency with modern workflow management systems (e.g., Nextflow, Snakemake, Airflow).\nExperience with privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) techniques and the challenges of working with de-identified patient data.\nFamiliarity with federated data systems and architectures.\nExperience working in a regulated data environment (e.g., FISMA, HIPAA).\n\nDisclaimer: The above description is meant to illustrate the general nature of work and level of effort being performed by individuals assigned to this position or job description.
