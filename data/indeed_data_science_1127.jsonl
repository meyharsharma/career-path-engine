So in 2013, after seeing our friends and family struggle with student loans, we created Splash Financial.\nOver the years, our mission has expanded to include helping people with other forms of debt - such as refinancing credit cards, which are at all time highs in the US. And we've been able to refinance $6+ Billion in loans through our network of Splash, powered credit union and bank partners who leverage our marketplace and automated loan processing technology. And we've raised over $135 million from investors like partners of DST Global, Citi Ventures, TruStage Ventures, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Detroit Venture Partners, and more.\nBut at our core, we're still that little company from Cleveland with a big dream: to make people more powerful than their debt and we're just getting started..\nABOUT OUR WORKPLACE:\nSplash is remote-first, and proud of it.\nWe spend our days simplifying financial products and getting them into the hands of people who need them most.

Yes, we even have Slack channels for #kids-and-pets and #food because we believe being human makes us better teammates.\nABOUT THE ROLE:\nSplash Financial is seeking a Data Scientist with strong programming skills in Python and experience creating complex algorithm models.\nThe ideal candidate is tenacious, proactive, and takes ownership of their deliverables.
